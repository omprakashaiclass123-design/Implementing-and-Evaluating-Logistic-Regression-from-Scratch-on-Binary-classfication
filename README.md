# Implementing-and-Evaluating-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch-on-Binary-classfication
This project implements logistic regression from scratch using NumPy, including sigmoid, binary cross-entropy, and gradient descent. It evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1, then compares results and learned weights with scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression to analyze performance and convergence.
